# Video-Frame-Duplication-Detection-CNN
Frame duplication, a common video tampering technique, involves copying and reinserting frames within footage. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are deep learning models designed for visual data, using convolutional layers, ReLU activations, pooling layers, and fully connected layers to extract features and generate predictions.
